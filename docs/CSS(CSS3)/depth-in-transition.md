# Basis

## when is the transition hanppend
- First the transition property has to be defined
- The transition-supported property is defined explictly
- The newly defined property value must be valid and actually influence the physical position of element
- Transition won't work on some value of certain property such as 'auto' of height to pixcel vlaue and vice versa
- 

> Adding 'transition' does not trigger transition, changing property dose.
> Sometimes property value change doesn't change position of one element, such as the 'margin-top' to a positioned element, as a consequence
no transition won't be tiggered.
